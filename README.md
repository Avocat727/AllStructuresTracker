## Requirements

For the macro to work properly you will need to install the following things:

- [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

- Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Avocat727/AllStructuresTracker/releases) page and download the latest version.
- Extract the zip file wherever you want.
- Open up command prompt, and run this command in `pip install Pillow`

You can edit the `tracker.ahk` file and go to the bottom of the script to change the hotkeys.

When you want to check out a structure, you just need to press `Mouse Button 4` (default key) and click on the corresponding structure. Just press the `Clear` button if you need to reset.

## Overlay

The tracker contains an overlay that you can display for your streams. You only need to add an `Image` source on OBS and select the `overlay.png` file. It will update everytime you click a button on the tracker.
